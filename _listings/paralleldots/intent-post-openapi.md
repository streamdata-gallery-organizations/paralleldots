    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    This classifier tells whether the underlying intention behind a sentence is opinion, news, marketing, complaint, suggestion, apprectiation, query. This is trained on our proprietary dataset.

    # Overview
    Things that the developers should know about

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.

    Response will be in JSON as shown below:

    ```
    {
        "probabilities": {
            "marketing": 0.038,
            "news": 0.916,
            "query": 0.008,
            "feedback/opinion": 0.017,
            "spam/junk": 0.02

        "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
        "intent": "news"
    }

    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


    # Rate limit
    Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

    There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.

        # Introduction
        What does your API do?

        Sometimes the three classes of sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) are not sufficient to understand the nuances regarding the underlying tone of a sentence. Our Emotion Analysis classifier is trained on our proprietary dataset and tells whether the underlying emotion behind a message is: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Excited, Funny or Indifferent.
