    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Sentiment API accepts input text, language code and API key to return a JSON response classifying the input text into a sentiment.

    # Overview
    Things that the developers should know about

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.Languages supported are German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl), Italian (it), Spanish (es), Chinese (zh), Portuguese (pt), Japanese (ja), Indonesian (id), Thai (th), Danish (da), Finish (fi)

    Response will be in JSON sorted by confidence score as shown below:

    ```
    {
        "probabilities": {
            "positive": 0.241,
            "neutral": 0.304,
            "negative": 0.454
        },
        "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
        "sentiment": "negative"
    }
    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


    # Rate limit
    Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

    There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.

    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Sometimes the three classes of sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) are not sufficient to understand the nuances regarding the underlying tone of a sentence. Our Emotion Analysis classifier is trained on our proprietary dataset and tells whether the underlying emotion behind a message is: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Excited, Funny or Indifferent.
