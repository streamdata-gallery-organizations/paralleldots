    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Sometimes the three classes of sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) are not sufficient to understand the nuances regarding the underlying tone of a sentence. Our Emotion Analysis classifier is trained on our proprietary dataset and tells whether the underlying emotion behind a message is: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Excited, Funny or Indifferent.

    # Overview

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.Languages supported are German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl), Italian (it), Spanish (es), Chinese (zh), Portuguese (pt), Japanese (ja), Indonesian (id), Thai (th), Danish (da), Finish (fi)

    Response will be in JSON as shown below:

    ```
